# iFio Password Vault project
This README will get updated as I develop the project.

## Overview
This is a project that is inspired in the password handling that a backend server usually is incharge of. I wanted to challenge myself and build a responsive web application that allows you to create an account, log in and give you access, all from the frontend.
From my understanding at this point in time, I should be able to execute this successfully.
